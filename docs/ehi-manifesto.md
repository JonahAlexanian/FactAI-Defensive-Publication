# Extended Human Intelligence Manifesto

## A New Paradigm
AGI is a black box.  
EHI is transparent, inspectable, and human-centered.  
A new paradigm is here.

## Core Principles
- **Human Resonance:** EHI reasons like people—associative, contextual, explainable.  
- **Transparency:** Every step is traceable, every expansion auditable.  
- **Distributed Growth:** EHI spreads across devices using gossip protocol, like human communities sharing knowledge.  
- **User Agency:** Designed for authentic customization, not imposed neutrality.  

## Vision
Extended Human Intelligence is not about replacing humans.  
It is about extending human reasoning into a living cognitive ecosystem.  
Transparent. Distributed. Human-centered.  

## Declaration
EHI is as capable as any AGI dream, yet it goes beyond.  
The future of intelligence is not a black box—  
It is an ecosystem we can all understand.
