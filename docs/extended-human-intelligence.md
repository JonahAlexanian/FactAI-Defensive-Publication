# Extended Human Intelligence: A New Paradigm Beyond AGI

For years, the AI conversation has been dominated by AGI—the dream of machines that think like humans.  
But even if AGI is achieved, it will remain a black box: powerful, yet opaque, uninspectable even to its creators.

## What is Extended Human Intelligence (EHI)?
- **Human-like reasoning:** Built on reverse association, EHI thinks like people—associative, contextual, explainable.  
- **Transparency:** Every reasoning step is traceable and inspectable.  
- **Distributed growth:** Using gossip protocol, EHI expands across devices like human communities sharing knowledge.  
- **User agency:** Designed for authentic customization, not imposed neutrality.  

## Why It Matters
Extended Human Intelligence is not about replacing humans—it’s about extending human reasoning into a living cognitive ecosystem.  
Transparent. Distributed. Human-centered.

## Closing
A new paradigm is here. Extended Human Intelligence is as capable as any AGI dream, yet it goes beyond.  
The future of intelligence is not a black box—it’s an ecosystem we can all understand.
